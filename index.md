<span style="font-size: 3em; float: left; line-height: 1; margin-right: 0.1em;">I</span>’m Surya, a tech enthusiast fueled by curiosity and creativity. I love exploring new technologies, solving problems, and crafting innovative solutions tha t make an impact. Right now, I’m diving deep into cloud computing, web development, and automation—turning ideas into reality one line of code at a time.

When I’m not at my desk, you’ll likely find me experimenting with new tools, learning something exciting, or enjoying a quiet moment with coffee and my thoughts.
